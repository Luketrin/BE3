<p>I wish you the best for the rest of your life</p>
<p>Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes</p>
<p>But I need to confess, I told you a lie</p>
<p>I said you, you were the love of my life</p>
<p>The love of my life</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Did I break your heart?</p>
<p>Did I waste your time?</p>
<p>I tried to be there for you</p>
<p>Then you tried to break mine</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>It isn't asking for a lot for an apology</p>
<p>For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave</p>
<p>You said you'd never fall in love again because of me</p>
<p>Then you moved on immediately</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>(Bum-bum-bum)</p>
<p>But I wish you the best for the rest of your life</p>
<p>Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes</p>
<p>But I need to confess (confess), I told you a lie (I told you a lie)</p>
<p>When I said you (when I said you, ooh), you (ooh) were the love of my life</p>
<p>The love of my life</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>So you found her, now go fall in love (now go fall in love)</p>
<p>Just like we were if I ever was (if I ever was)</p>
<p>It's not my fault (no), I did what I could (I did what I could)</p>
<p>You made it so hard, like I knew you would</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Thought I was depressed or losing my mind</p>
<p>My stomach upset, almost all of the time</p>
<p>But after I left, it was obvious why (why, oh), mm</p>
<p>Because for you, you, I was the love of your life, mm</p>
<p>But you were not mine</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>It isn't asking for a lot for an apology</p>
<p>For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave</p>
<p>You said you'd never fall in love again because of me</p>

<p>Then you moved on, then you moved on</p>
<p>Then you moved on, then you moved on</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Ooh, you wanted to keep it</p>
<p>Like something you found</p>
<p>Till you didn't need it</p>
<p>But you should've seen it</p>
<p>The way it went down</p>
<p>You wouldn't believe it</p>
<p>Wanna know what I told her</p>
<p>You were so mediocre</p>
<p>And we're so glad it's over now</p>

<p>To take my love away</p>
<p>When I come back around, will I know what to say?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Said you won't forget my name</p>
<p>Not today</p>
<p>Not tomorrow</p>
<p>Kinda strange</p>
<p>Feeling sorrow</p>
<p>I got change (yeah)</p>
<p>You could borrow (borrow)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>When I come back around, will I know what to say?</p>
<p>Not today</p>
<p>Maybe tomorrow</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Open up the door, can you open up the door?</p>
<p>I know you said before you can't cope with any more</p>
<p>You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store</p>
<p>I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Did you</p>
<p>Take</p>
<p>My love</p>
<p>Away</p>
<p>From me, me?</p>
<p>Me</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away</p>
<p>Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face</p>
<p>Said: I need to be alone now, I'm taking a break</p>
<p>How come when I returned you were gone away?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I don't</p>
<p>I don't know why I called</p>
<p>I don't know you at all</p>
<p>I don't know you</p>
<p>Not at all</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I don't</p>
<p>I don't know why I called</p>
<p>I don't know you at all</p>
<p>I don't know you</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Did you</p>
<p>Take</p>
<p>My love</p>
<p>Away</p>
<p>From me, me?</p>
<p>Me</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>And that's when you found me</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I was waiting in the garden</p>
<p>Contemplating, beg your pardon</p>
<p>But there's a part of me that recognizes you</p>
<p>Do you feel it too?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>When you told me it was serious</p>
<p>Were you serious? Mmm</p>
<p>They told me they were only curious</p>
<p>Now it's serious, mmm</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Open up the door, can you open up the door?</p>
<p>I know you said before you can't cope with any more</p>
<p>You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store</p>
<p>I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Wringing my hands in my lap</p>
<p>And they tell me it's all been a trap</p>
<p>And you don't know if you'll make it back</p>
<p>I say: No, don't say that</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>(Wringing my hands in my lap)</p>
<p>(Tell me it's all been a trap)</p>
<p>(Don't know if you'll make it back)</p>
<p>I say: No, don't say that</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>(Wringing my hands in my lap)</p>
<p>(Tell me it's all been a trap)</p>
<p>(Don't know if you'll make it back)</p>
<p>(Don't say that)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Mhm</p>
